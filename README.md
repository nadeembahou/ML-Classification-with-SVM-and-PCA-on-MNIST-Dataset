# MNIST Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements classification algorithms for the MNIST dataset, focusing on various machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), PCA, feature ranking, and more. 
The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits based on pixel intensity features.

## Datasets
- **MNIST PCA**: Contains results of PCA dimensionality reduction applied to the MNIST dataset.
- **MNIST Feature Ranking**: Contains feature ranking results for the MNIST dataset.
- **Iris Dataset**: Used for classification experiments involving another well-known dataset.
- **trainFeatures42k.xls**: A larger dataset for training classification algorithms, available for various analyses.
